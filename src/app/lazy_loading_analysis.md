# Lazy Loading Analysis for CoordinateAppUi

## Current Routing Structure
The application currently uses eager loading for all routes, which means all components are loaded when the application starts, regardless of whether the user navigates to those routes.

## Candidates for Lazy Loading

Based on the routing structure, the following feature areas are good candidates for lazy loading:

### 1. Admin Module
- Already exists as a module
- Contains multiple components (UserList, RoleList, etc.)
- Likely only accessed by administrators
- High priority for lazy loading

### 2. Settings Module
- Already exists as a module
- Contains configuration components
- Not frequently accessed by all users
- High priority for lazy loading

### 3. Feature Components
- Customers component
- Products component
- Orders component
- Medium priority for lazy loading

### 4. History and Journal Features
- History component
- Driving Journal component
- Contains complex functionality
- Medium priority for lazy loading

### 5. Authentication Components
- Login component
- Register component
- Recover/Reset Password components
- Lower priority (often needed early in user journey)

### 6. Route Planning Features
- RouteView component
- CustomerWithWorkItemTable component
- WorkItemTable component
- Medium priority for lazy loading

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Create Feature Modules**: For components that don't already have modules, create feature modules to group related functionality.

2. **Implement Lazy Loading**: Update the routing configuration to use lazy loading for each feature area.

3. **Use Standalone Component Approach**: Leverage the newly migrated standalone components with the loadComponent syntax.

4. **Prioritize Implementation**: Start with high-priority candidates (Admin, Settings) and then move to medium-priority ones.

## Expected Benefits

- Reduced initial bundle size
- Faster application startup time
- Improved performance on low-bandwidth connections
- Better resource utilization

## Potential Challenges

- Ensuring proper module boundaries
- Handling shared services and dependencies
- Maintaining proper authentication guards
- Testing all lazy-loaded routes thoroughly
