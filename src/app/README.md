4. Updated app.module.ts:
   - Removed NgModule declarations for standalone components
   - Added proper imports for standalone components

## How to Integrate

To integrate these changes into your project:

1. Replace each file in your project with the corresponding file from this package
2. Pay special attention to app.module.ts, which has been updated to properly import all standalone components
3. Ensure all imports are correctly resolved
4. Test each component after integration

## Migration Pattern

Each component has been migrated following this pattern:

1. Added `standalone: true` to the component decorator
2. Added `imports` array with all required dependencies
3. Added `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` where needed for custom elements
4. Imported CommonModule and other required Angular modules
5. Updated app.module.ts to remove declarations and add imports

## Next Steps

After integrating these changes, consider:

1. Migrating any remaining components not covered in this package
2. Testing all components thoroughly to ensure functionality is preserved
3. Updating routing configuration as needed
4. Implementing lazy loading for feature modules
