# Standalone Component Migration Complete

This project has been fully migrated to use Angular's standalone components architecture.

## Removed Files

The following files have been removed as they're no longer needed with the standalone component architecture:

- `/src/app/app-routing.module.ts` - Replaced with direct use of `provideRouter` in main.ts
- `/src/app/app.module.ts` - Replaced with bootstrapApplication in main.ts
- `/src/app/shared.module.ts` - Replaced with direct imports in components
- `/src/app/shared/shared.module.ts` - Replaced with direct imports in components
- `/src/app/admin.module.ts` - Replaced with direct component imports
- `/src/app/admin/admin.module.ts` - Replaced with direct component imports
- `/src/app/admin/admin-routing.module.ts` - Replaced with routes array in admin.routes.ts
- `/src/app/settings/settings.module.ts` - Replaced with direct component imports
- `/src/app/modules/syncfusion.module.ts` - Replaced with direct imports from syncfusion-imports.ts

## New Files

The following new files have been created to support the standalone component architecture:

- `/src/app/shared/common-imports.ts` - Common Angular imports for standalone components
- `/src/app/shared/syncfusion-imports.ts` - Syncfusion component imports for standalone components
- `/src/app/admin/admin.routes.ts` - Admin routes for standalone components
- `/src/app/services/url-serializer.ts` - LowerCaseUrlSerializer moved from app-routing.module.ts
